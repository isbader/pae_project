## Title: Factors That Influence Views on Gender-Segregated Higher Education 

## Synopsis:
**As universities are gender-segregated while the workplace is mostly a mixed-gender environment, 
it generates a gender communication gap which negatively affects productivity in the workplace. 
The aim of this research is to decide whether the gender-segregated education system of Saudi Arabia should be reviewed. 
This can be determined by highlighting factors that influence gender views and implications in the workplace. 
We found factors that significantly affect gender interactions in the workplace which are the level of conservatism, 
introversion, comfort in interacting with the opposite gender, exposure to mixed-gender higher education.**
